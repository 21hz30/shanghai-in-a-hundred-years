									<p>The Peace Hotel is a landmark of the Bund as well as one of the most iconic architectures in the whole Shanghai. It is located at the intersection of East Nanjing Road and the Bund. Over the years, the Peace Hotel has had many names: the southern building was originally known as the Hui Zhong Hotel, while the northern building used to be the Cathay Hotel. Because it was funded by the prominent Jewish Sassoon family during World War II, it was also known as the Sassoon Building. After the two buildings were merged, they became what we now know now as the Peace Hotel.</p>
									<p>The Peace Hotel was commissioned by businessman Victor Sassoon and built in 1929, featuring mostly Art Deco style. Its representative Art Deco elements include a unique green copper roof, luxurious interiors, and simple vertical lines as the main structural design. The hotel is luxurious, unrivaled as once the tallest building in Shanghai, as well as one of the first buildings in the world to be equipped with an air conditioning system. Many historical figures, such as Charlie Chaplin and George Bernard Shaw, paid visits and left behind photos and memories.</p>
									<p>To the right of the main entrance is a narrow staircase leading up to a small room on the second floor. There sits a display room recording the history of the hotel including photos, tableware, furniture, small sculptures and other precious items.</p>
									<p>In 1992, the Peace Hotel was designated a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Site. Today, it still retains its strong retro charm. Because the building is open to the public, it has become a “must” for tourists from all over China when coming to Shanghai. The Peace Hotel stands as more than a building, but a symbol of Shanghai’s history and culture.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>The ground floor of the Peace Hotel is the Victor’s Cafe, a coffee shop with decor aligns perfectly with the style of the entire building. I often wander along the Bund with my parents, sometimes we would go across the bustling East Nanjing Road. Once we decided to stop by the cafe in the Peace Hotel for afternoon tea and took the chance to explore a bit inside.</p>
									<p>Over twenty years ago, my parents held their wedding at the Peace Hotel, which makes this historic building especially meaningful to our family. I hadn’t been there for their wedding two decades ago, but we decided that we could still visit the banquet hall together to see the venue and what it looks like now. The room was quiet and spacious, with a slender rectangular formation. The entrance cut in from the middle of the long side, which is quite different from the layout and design of most modern wedding halls. Opposing the entrance was a small area that juts out slightly, which was the very spot where my parents took group photos with friends and relatives back then.</p>
									<p>Our family has kept a printed photo from that day, including my grandparents and cousin. Since digital photography was rare twenty years ago, the images we have are all printed on photographic paper, with a distinct vintage texture. Though the picture quality and lighting is old, you can still clearly make out the interior design and structure, which remain unchanged to this day.</p>
									<p>The Peace Hotel, now nearly a century old, still stands tall and proud. It is one of the few historic buildings in Shanghai that remains open for the public to freely explore. Standing in the same spot where my parents got married decades ago, I felt a thrilling sense of time folding in on itself.</p>

									<p>The Majestic Theatre was built in 1941 and is located at 66 Jiangning Road in present-day Shanghai. The name “Majestic" was chosen to provoke a sense of perfection and elegance, suggesting something magnificent and flawless like fine jade. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, it was temporarily renamed Beijing Cinema & Theatre.</p>
									<p>Designed by architect Fan Wenzhao, the theatre was constructed using concrete, decorated in the manner of Art Deco style, becoming a typical icon of early 20th-century architecture. At the entrance, curved staircases and neon signage create a striking impression. The theatre holds 1261 seats and was once entitled as “Asian No. 1” in its time.</p>
									<p>The Majestic Theatre gained a solid reputation both domestically and internationally as one of the earliest multi-functioned performance centers in China. It was equipped in order to hold large-scale musicals, dance productions, ballet, and many other performance arts, serving as a key space for cultural exchange between China and the world. Legendary Peking opera artist Mei Lanfang and other renowned performers have performed here. Even today, the theatre continues to host fine performances and stands as one of Shanghai’s most important cultural landmarks.</p>
									<p>The theatre is situated near the “Mei-Heng-Tai” golden triangle: the fashionable Mei Long Town Plaza, one of the first shopping malls in Shanghai to be funded by Japanese capital; CITIC Square, a mix of commercial complex operated by CITIC Group; and Plaza 66, which remains a benchmark for luxury fashion in Puxi.</p>
									<p>In recent years, as Shanghai’s commercial development expands gradually, each administrative district has cultivated its own shopping and cultural hubs. As a result, traffic at the intersection of Jiangning Road and West Nanjing Road was left out bit by bit.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>The Majestic Theatre has gradually lost its competitiveness in the market due to a combination of factors: outdated facilities, a lack of timely strategic adjustments, and a rather traditional operating model. However, with the recent reopening of Mei Long Town Plaza nearby, foot traffic and visibility at this intersection may increase, and the Majestic Theatre—with its unique architectural features and rich historical legacy—has the potential to reemerge as a cultural and historical hotspot popular among visitors and social media users.</p>
									<p>A noteworthy highlight is the Manner Coffee shop located at the side entrance of the theatre’s podium. Located within the historical structure of the theatre, this cafe offers a distinctive charm. It serves as a fusion of heritage architecture and artisanal coffee culture. Small but refined, quiet and calming. Pushing through the antique wooden doors into the long, dimly lit space, it is easy to immerse in an atmosphere steeped in history. Even a quick takeaway coffee is infused with the lingering charm of the past. This unique ambiance has made it a trending check-in spot for both locals and tourists.</p>
									<p>But this cafe is more than just a place for coffee—it serves as a cultural bridge between audiences and the theatre, redefining the use of a historic building, and enhances the brand value of the Majestic Theatre. It is a prime example of how commercial value revives and boosts the spirit of a place.</p>

									<p>The Si Hang Warehouse, located at Guangfu Rd. No 21, was built in 1931 and rose to national fame during the 1937 defense against Japanese forces by the “800 Heroes.” Originally a reinforced concrete warehouse jointly owned by four major Chinese banks, it became a symbol of wartime resistance spirit when Commander Xie Jinyuan led his troops to hold off the Japanese army here during the Song Hu Battle.</p>
									<p>Today, many of the surrounding buildings near the Si Hang Warehouse remain well preserved and have been renovated into a modern art district. The west wall of the warehouse itself has been fully preserved, still bearing bullet holes and from war time, which serves as powerful reminders of the brutal history. It has become a major site for patriotic education and a must-visit landmark for those seeking to remember history and learn about the spirit of resistance.</p>
									<p>In 2015, the warehouse was transformed into the Sihang Warehouse Battle Memorial, commemorating its legacy in China’s war of resistance against Japan.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>Due to its prime location on the south of Suzhou River—often referred to as the mother river of southern Shanghai—the Sihang Warehouse enjoys a unique and pleasant landscape. The adjacent old buildings have been preserved and transformed into cafés, restaurants, boutique shops, and art galleries. Among them, People’s Cafe stands out for its distinctive style gaining considerable popularity.</p>
									<p>The name “People’s Café” carries a bold and resonant tone—memorable and full of character. Its interior is thoughtfully designed, with red elements woven throughout the space. Neon lights hang from the ceiling, while the overall dim lighting creates an immersive and indulgent atmosphere. The retro decor, daring and quirky cultural-creative items, and displays of colorful vintage stamps all make it an irresistible photo spot for visitors.</p>
									<p>After visiting the Si Hang Warehouse and its museum, it could be a novel experience to sit down here for a cup of coffee—a blend of the weight of history with the rhythm of contemporary life. Coffee, a symbol of the urban sophistication and lifestyle unique to Shanghai, naturally pops up everywhere. At almost every historical site, you’ll find a coffee shop nearby. In such a way, drinking coffee while visiting places might just give me a new lens through which to see and engage with the city’s past.</p>

									<p>The Moller Villa, located at South Shaanxi Rd. No30, was built in 1936 by British-Jewish tycoon Eric Moller as a fairytale castle for his daughter. Consisting of six brick & concrete structures, the villa covers 5000 square meters, standing as a dreamland in the heart of downtown Shanghai. Combining Northern European and traditional Chinese architectural elements, Moller Villa uses spires, stained-glass windows, and gardens. The villa therefore presents a sharp contrast to the city’s typical architectural styles.</p>
									<p>Moller made his fortune through horse racing. Early in his career, he used a single horse as capital to gain entry into the prestigious Shanghai Race Club. With his skills in horsemanship and strategic social ties with the city’s elite, he accumulated immense wealth in just three years—enough to fulfill his dream of building a fantasy mansion for his daughter. In homage to the source of his fortune, a bronze horse statue stands in the garden, symbolizing his success. Moller even hung a sign reading “FAIRYLAND” beneath the villa’s eaves, marking it as the enchanted land from his daughter’s dreams.</p>
									<p>After 1949, the Moller Villa became the office of the Shanghai Municipal Communist Youth League. Due to its official function, the building was closed to the public for decades, concealing much of its charm from the outside world. However, with urban development and historical preservation efforts, the villa was eventually transformed into a boutique hotel that captures the nostalgic elegance of old Shanghai. Now open to the public, this “most fantastical old Western-style house in Shanghai” has finally unveiled its long-hidden magic.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>Inside the Moller Villa is a Western-style restaurant called Beile VILLA, where you can enjoy an afternoon coffee paired with tea-time delicacies. It’s the perfect spot for both admiring the castle and lawn views, and for indulging in a relaxing, unhurried break.</p>
									<p>Here, a single cup of coffee transports you into the world of a fairy-tale princess. The traditional English afternoon tea setup—complete with beautifully crafted tableware—adds to the dreamy experience. On a pleasant day, sitting by the garden with a cup of tea and chatting leisurely feels wonderfully serene.</p>
									<p>What’s more, enjoying afternoon tea here also gives you rare, up-close access to this enchanting historic mansion. So rather than simply calling it a coffee break, it feels more like a whimsical journey through a real-life fairy tale.</p>

									<p>The Statue of Peace was once erected where British and French concessions intersect in wartime Shanghai and where Bund and East Yanan Road conjoin at the present. Being set in 1924, The Statue of Peace commemorated the Shanghai expatriates that died during WWI.</p>
									<p>The monument has a main rectangular structure supported by a concrete base reinforced by steel and a hollow interior. The exterior was covered with granite, and the names of the commemorated were engraved on its surface. On top of the monument stood a bronze figure of the Goddess of Peace, modeled after sculptures from ancient Rome.</p>
									<p>A prominent feature of the statue was her outstretched wings, and powerful arms embracing a child into her protection, symbolizing peace and guardianship.</p>
									<p>However, after Japanese troops invaded Shanghai in 1941, the statue, seen as a symbol of British and French production, was violently destroyed due to Japan’s hostile relations with the Allies. Due to the high cost, the British gave up on restoring the statue after war, and the memorial never came back to us.</p>
									<p>Today, the original site remains an open plaza decorated with shrubs, now part of the Bund’s public space. No other new structure has been set up there, leaving it purely as a public landscape.</p>
									<p>However, in Shanghai Film Park, located in Songjiang District, a replica of the Statue of Peace has been erected. As a filming location for many movies and shows regarding WWI Shanghai, the park recreates street views in early 20th century Shanghai, offering a glimpse of the statue as it once stood.</p>

								<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>The Bund, taking the stunning riverside views, filled with old international architecture, and the iconic trio skyscrapers in Pudong, attracts numerous visitors from around the world. Even local citizens would gather with family and friends to enjoy an afternoon tea or a sun-drenched brunch at either a classic old establishment or a trendy new spot.</p>
									<p>There are countless cafes and Western restaurants worth going along the Bund, but one especially worth noticing is POP, located on the 7th floor of Bund No. 3, located at the diagonal opposite the original site of the Statue of Peace.</p>
									<p>What makes POP truly special is its terrace with the unsurpassable river view. From sunset to the first glow of city lights, the historic international buildings suddenly light up in a breathtaking spectacle, a moment of awe that only those who have witnessed it can truly appreciate.</p>
									<p>Even ordering the simplest cup of coffee you get the privilege to enjoy a 270-degree view of the skyline.</p>

									<p>Standing at the intersection of East Zhongshan First Road and East Yanan Road on the Bund, the Gutzlaff Signal Tower is a 50-meter structure tower built in 1907. It was once the busiest maritime signal pole in Shanghai, witnessing over a century of changes in shipping along the Huangpu River.</p>
									<p>Designed by Spanish innovator and industrialist Modesto Marti de Sola, the tower features a unique architectural style including a blend of reinforced brick construction, Baroque domes, and classical columns. It is one of only two remaining buildings worldwide with this distinctive style.</p>
									<p>Before the radio communication was widely used, the tower’s weathervane, signal balls, and the noon “time ball” played a critical role, providing essential meteorological, tidal, and timekeeping information to all ships passing. It was then considered a wisest early 20th-century maritime assistant.</p>
									<p>In 1993, this 450-ton structure underwent an astonishing “relocation,” moving the entire structure 20 meters eastward, a landmarking achievement in Shanghai’s architectural preservation history.</p>
									<p>Though no longer in use today, this historic building, listed in the China Industrial Heritage Protection Register, still silently speaks its own narrative of Shanghai’s transformation from a shipping port to an international trading center, making it one of the Bund’s most distinctive historical landmarks.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>For a period of time, the Signal Tower also housed a café on the second floor, while the ground floor served as a historical exhibit. Unfortunately, this café inside the protected heritage building was closed down.</p>
									<p>Just a five-minute walk away, at the crossroad on Fuzhou Road, another cafe called Dugout is highly recommended. What makes Dugout special is its charitable mission: all the baristas are either deaf or hearing-impaired. Customers place orders using a writing pad or simple sign language and even enjoy discounts for doing so.</p>
									<p>The cafe’s interior is designed in a cave-like style, making use of the rough walls and arched structures typical of the Bund’s historic architecture, evoking the atmosphere of an old air-raid shelter.</p>
									<p>When you order a coffee here, you’re not just buying a drink—you’re participating in an exchange built on courage, understanding, and equality. Customers mimic sign language gestures as hearing-impaired baristas skillfully craft the caffeinated art. Through this mutual effort, a quiet yet profound dialogue of respect and connection unfolds.</p>
									<p>During the century-long history of the Bund, the brightness of respect, equality, dignity and honor enlighten the already wondrous street views.</p>

									<p>The Paramount Ballroom, located at Yuyuan Rds No.218, was established in 1933 and is officially known as “Shanghai Paramount.” Entitled the glory of “Foremost Entertainment Palace of the Far East,” the ballroom stands as an iconic symbol of Shanghai’s Golden Age. The name “Paramount” conveys the meaning of “supreme” or “the highest,” while its Chinese name 百乐门 literally means “enter the door, and all joys should be”</p>
									<p>Architecturally, Paramount blends Art Deco with modern styles. The floors are paved with black-and-white marble tiles, and the interior is lavish and grand. Curved designs appear throughout the ballroom, elevators, and handrails—hallmarks of early 20th-century popular architectural trends.</p>
									<p>Inside, the ballroom houses several dance halls equipped with spring-loaded dance floors and top-tier jazz bands, hosting a variety of music and dance events. In the 1940s, celebrities such as Zhang Xueliang and Xu Zhimo were frequent patrons. The ballroom was closed during the Cultural Revolution but underwent several renovations and reopened in 2017, continuing to celebrate the song-and-dance culture of old Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Situated in today’s bustling Jing’an Temple commercial district, although it no longer draws crowds like it once did, Paramount remains one of Shanghai’s most renowned and historic landmarks.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>Just a hundred meters south of Paramount Ballroom along Huashan Road is a newly opened café called Shanghai Coffee. With over a hundred cafés near Jing’an Temple, this one stands out as truly unique. Some say it’s not “authentic,” others call it an old-fashioned flavor—but drinking coffee here is really about savoring a nostalgic Shanghai coffee culture.</p>
									<p>The story begins in 1935, when Zhejiang businessman Zhang Bao established the first Chinese-owned coffee shop in Shanghai at 1442 Jing’an Temple Road (now the corner of Nanjing West Road and Tongren Road). Named Desheng Coffee Import Company, it was later reorganized into the Shanghai Coffee Factory. Besides their classic Shanghai-branded coffee, popular products included Lekoufu (a malted milk drink), malt extract, chrysanthemum essence, and more. In times of scarcity, these beverages were considered luxurious treats—a sweet memory for many childhoods.</p>
									<p>Though the new Shanghai Coffee café is not located at the original site, it sits amid a neighborhood shaded by plane trees and surrounded by historic landmarks like Cai Yuanpei’s former residence and the Shanghai Grand Theatre. It’s the perfect cozy spot for a restful pause or a casual chat.</p>

									<p>The Shanghai Concert Hall standing at the crossroad of East Yanan Road and Longmen Road blends a classical European style with Eastern charm—. Originally built in 1930 as the Nanjing Grand Theatre, it was masterfully designed by Chinese architect Fan Wenzhao. Its grand Roman-style columns, gilded dome, and ornate portico immediately earned it the reputation as the “Foremost Cinema of the Far East.” As Shanghai’s first cinema equipped with sound projection, it hosted the Asian premieres of Hollywood golden age films like Broadway and, in 1932, saw the debut symphony performance by the Municipal Orchestra—an event that unexpectedly marked the beginning of its legendary status as a music sanctuary.</p>
									<p>In a remarkable engineering feat in 2003, this 5,650-ton building was “walked” 66 meters eastward at a pace of 2 centimeters per day, completing what is considered one of the most romantic relocations in architectural history. The relocated concert hall preserved its striking red marble colonnade and golden dome while achieving acoustic enhancements that precisely control reverberation time to 1.5 seconds—a miracle number praised by conductor Chen Xieyang as second only to Vienna’s Golden Hall. Inside, the Steinway D-274 grand piano (serial number 568163) has resonated alongside masters like Yo-Yo Ma and Fou Ts’ong. The dome’s 24K gold leaf, reapplied in 2004, still gleams under the lights with the elegant flair of 1930s Shanghai.</p>
									<p>From the grand 13-day opera run by Mei Lanfang, to the annual imprint of the Shanghai Spring music festival; from its brief renaming as the “Revolutionary Music Hall” during a turbulent era, to its pioneering rebranding as the “Music Cube” in the new millennium—this timeless ark of the arts has continuously held the city’s collective memories within its 1,200 seats.</p>
									<p>During the latest restoration in 2020, workers unexpectedly discovered the original 1930s architectural drawings, turning the repair project into a dialogue spanning ninety years. Today, the golden dome’s glow mingles with the neon lights of the Yan’an elevated highway at dusk, Shanghai Concert Hall continues its mission of “art for the people” with three weekly public performances—just as firmly anchored in the city’s cultural DNA as the foundation left behind when it was moved.</p>

									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">

									<p>The Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC) Bank Building—now the China Everbright Bank’s Bund Branch—is located at No. 29 The Bund. Built in 1914, it was an important financial institution during the French colonial period.</p>
									<p>This classicist architectural gem features an ornate façade, with interiors adorned by marble columns and intricate reliefs. After World War II, the bank withdrew, and the building was used by various organizations.

									<p>The popular TV drama Blossoms has brought renewed attention to the old Donghai area making it the trending place for dating. As one of Shanghai’s oldest coffee shops with a century-long history, Donghai Café experienced was closed down for renovation before being restored and reopened. Its overall style was however well-preserved as vintage and nostalgic, located on Dianchi Road.</p>
									<p>Donghai Café was once the fashionable hotspot where “Lao Yasuo” (old uncles) longed for in their youth. The iced coffee there carries a classic, old-school flavor, and the traditional butter cake offers the firm, creamy texture reminiscent of childhood malt cream treats. Alongside the coffee, the café serves Western-style pastries like the iconic “Hadou” and “Napoleon”—quirky names that a hundred years ago were exclusive staples on the menus of Shanghai’s stylish elite.</p>
									<p>Nestled near the century-old Bund architectural cluster, Donghai Café stands as a living emblem of Shanghai—a tangible yet invisible history that writes a new chapter in the city’s ongoing embrace and inheritance of coffee, a culture brought from overseas.</p>

									<p>Jinjiang Hotel—A Century of Glamour on South Maoming Road—Nestled beneath the plane trees at No. 59 South Maoming Road, two distinctly styled historic buildings—the Cathay Apartment (1929) and the Grosvenor House (1935)—together form the legendary Jinjiang Hotel, a landmark in Shanghai’s hospitality scene. Founded in 1951 by the pioneering businesswoman Dong Zhujun, Jinjiang was the first foreign-oriented hotel established in the newly founded People’s Republic of China.</p>
									<p>Its unique architectural pairing—Gothic towers clashing harmoniously with Art Deco lines—has witnessed countless diplomatic milestones. In 1972, President Nixon drafted the Shanghai Communiqué here; in 1986, Queen Elizabeth II dined on the hotel’s signature Jinjiang roast duck.</p>
									<p>The 13-story Cathay Apartment, once famed as the “Thirteen Floors,” features one of Shanghai’s earliest Otis elevators, tucked behind its bronze-framed revolving door. The Grosvenor House, arranged in the shape of the Chinese character “八” (eight), boasts curved balconies and wrought-iron railings, capturing the modern flair of 1930s Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Today, as a five-star hotel, Jinjiang preserves its rich legacy: Chairman Mao’s suite remains intact; beneath the crystal chandeliers of the small auditorium hang archival photographs from the signing of the Sino-American Joint Communiqué. In the hotel’s 30,000-square-meter garden, the cedar tree planted jointly by Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk still spreads its graceful canopy.</p>
									<p>From Republican-era celebrities to contemporary statesmen, from gangland tycoons to global magnates, this Shanghai cultural relic with 442 guest rooms continues to live up to its reputation: “One hotel, half of modern Shanghai’s history.”</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>Dream Café 1926: Savoring a Century in a Sip</p>
									<p>Located in the north wing of the Jinjiang Hotel, Dream Café 1926 is less a café and more a time capsule of old Shanghai. Built in tandem with the hotel itself, this space has witnessed nearly a century of history. Though recently renovated, it retains a distinctly vintage charm: sunlight spills gently through its glass dome, bathing the room in a warm, serene glow. To sit here with a cup of coffee is to step into a reel of historic film—every detail steeped in legend.</p>
									<p>It feels like stepping into the elite social salons of Republican-era Shanghai. Here, you can sink into the same velvet armchairs where Premier Zhou Enlai once drafted the Sino-American Joint Communiqué; walk across the spring-loaded teak floors that once hosted Soong Mei-ling’s charity balls; gaze up at a lapis-blue coffered ceiling modeled after the British Parliament; admire handcrafted Art Deco steel windows made by Jewish artisans.</p>
									<p>From the ceremonial siphon coffee served with silver sugar tongs, echoing the ritual of Café Richelieu, to the chestnut flour cake personally reimagined by Jinjiang founder Madam Dong Zhujun, every offering tells a story. You might even find yourself seated at the same round table where Charlie Chaplin dined during his 1936 visit to Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Stirring your coffee with a silver spoon here is to taste history itself—just as artist Chen Danqing once said:“What Shanghai people sip in their coffee is the flavor of history itself.”</p>

									<p>Shanghai Mansion: A Shining Jewel of the Bund</p>
									<p>Shanghai Mansion, formerly known as Broadway Mansions, is a dazzling architectural gem among the historic skyline of the Bund. Since its completion in 1934, this 22-story modernist tower, designed by British architect Bright Fraser, has drawn global attention with its distinctive charm. Rising 76.7 meters, the building stands at 20 North Suzhou Road, right where Suzhou Creek meets the Huangpu River, and was once the tallest hotel in Shanghai. To this day, it preserves countless precious traces of its storied past.</p>
									<p>Wandering through its interiors feels like stepping into a time capsule. Vintage elevators from the 1930s, intricate bronze detailing, and the nostalgic atmosphere transport visitors to another era. The 18th-floor observatory, once known as the “No. 1 Viewing Platform in the Far East,” offered panoramic views of the Bund and Huangpu River—a treasured memory for generations of Shanghainese.</p>
									<p>Originally built on the site of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company, the name “Broadway Mansions” was derived from Broadway Road (now Daming Road), not New York’s Broadway as commonly assumed. On May 1, 1951, the building was renamed Shanghai Mansion, becoming a prestigious venue for receiving foreign guests. Over the decades, it has hosted numerous international dignitaries, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
									<p>Today, as a five-star heritage hotel, Shanghai Mansion continues to exude elegance. Among its 248 guest rooms, the most sought-after are the luxury river-view suites, where guests can lie in bed and admire the iconic Waibaidu Bridge and Lujiazui skyline. Its still-operating 1930s elevators have become a beloved photo spot for tourists and locals alike. Just steps away from the Waibaidu Bridge, the mansion forms one of the most iconic vistas of the Bund. Each morning, photography enthusiasts gather to capture the first rays of sunlight hitting the building’s historic façade.</p>
									<p>From its origins as a symbol of British commercial presence to its current role as a cultural landmark, Shanghai Mansion has witnessed the city’s transformation—from the “Paris of the East” to a global metropolis. Among the 14 officially protected historic buildings along the Bund, it stands out for its architectural character and deep historical resonance—continuing to write its own legendary chapter in the evolving story of Shanghai.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>While the lobby bar and upper-level restaurants inside the Shanghai Mansion offer coffee and afternoon tea, just around the corner on Fude Road, hidden in a quiet alley, is a much more charming find: a 22-year-old hand-brew café run by a Shanghai local couple—ALT Matsuyastyle Pour-Over Coffee.</p>
									<p>One of Shanghai’s earliest Japanese-style single-origin hand-pour cafés, ALT not only pioneered this brewing style in the city but also helped cultivate and popularize a generation of local baristas trained in Japanese pour-over techniques.</p>
									<p>The coffee beans lined up on the counter are hand-selected and regularly brought back from Japan by the owners themselves. The cozy, compact space is thoughtfully arranged with brewing tools and storage vessels, exuding a warm and delicate ambiance.</p>
									<p>Here, the traditional Showa-era brewing method is elevated into a refined aesthetic of coffee precision. The owners’ decades-long dedication to craftsmanship delivers a consistently high-quality pour-over experience. More than just a drink, each cup offers a taste of culture, a moment of mindfulness.</p>
									<p>Take a sip of this warm, handcrafted brew while sitting on a narrow wooden bench. Strike up a light conversation with a stranger or two. Let the afternoon sun slant gently across your shoulders. Could there be a more peaceful way to enjoy the day?</p>

									<p>At the bustling crossroads of Huaihai Middle Road and Maoming South Road, one of Shanghai’s most iconic landmarks has stood quietly for nearly a century—Cathay Theatre, widely hailed as the most beautiful cinema in Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Built in 1930 and originally named Cathay Grand Theatre, the building was designed by Hungarian architect C. H. Gonda officially opened on New Year’s Day 1932. On its debut, Shenbao ran an ad that boldly proclaimed:</p>
									<p>“Luxurious and grand, it leads all cinemas in Shanghai; refined and comfortable, it embodies the height of modern science and design.”</p>
									<p>This confidence was no exaggeration. With its unmatched Art Deco façade, the Cathay instantly distinguished itself. The bold contrast between the deep purplish-red Taishan bricks and the crisp white grout, paired with its geometric, zigzag silhouette, gives the building a striking rhythm—especially under the plane trees that line Huaihai Road.</p>
									<p>Step inside and you’ll find red velvet curtains and elegant relief carvings that still echo the 1930s aura of cinematic luxury, frozen in time. Notably, the original seats were imported from the U.S.—the “Western Electric” brand—and each one had its own built-in heating vent, an extravagance that defined cutting-edge comfort in its day.</p>
									<p>In 1935, comedy legend Charlie Chaplin visited Shanghai and made a special stop here. After 1949, the cinema was renamed “Cathay Theatre” (Guotai Dianyingyuan); during political transitions, it briefly bore the name “People’s Cinema,” but locals never stopped calling it “Cathay.” In 1994, it was officially recognized as a Protected Historic Building of Shanghai, and in 2005, it earned the title of National Five-Star Cinema.</p>
									<p>From August 2022 to January 2024, the theatre underwent a major restoration—preserving its historical charm while upgrading its projection systems to meet modern standards.</p>
									<p>Today, Cathay boasts three uniquely styled screening rooms, still upholding the tradition of community screenings and half-price Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Watching a film here feels like listening to the echoes of history—from silent black-and-white reels in 1932 to today’s immersive IMAX soundscapes. Cathay isn’t just a cinema; it’s a living archive of Chinese film history and a vessel of collective memory for generations of Shanghainese. A fusion of architectural legacy and cultural devotion, the theatre continues to write its cinematic saga on Huaihai Road.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>When the plum rain season soaks Shanghai in its muggy, drizzling haze, take a walk under an umbrella along Maoming and Huaihai—streets steeped in the city’s nostalgic charm. Watch a classic old film at Cathay Theatre, then head downstairs to SHALA, the stylish café nestled in the podium.</p>
									<p>At one moment, it’s a torrential downpour; at the next, sunlight dapples through sycamore branches. Order a specialty coffee called “Plum Rain”—inspired by the verse:</p>
									<p>“How much idle sorrow is there? A river of misty willows, city-wide swirling fluff, the yellow plum rain…”</p>
									<p>The drink blends the tangy sweetness of golden plums with bright acidity for a refreshingly clean finish that washes away the stickiness of rainy days.</p>
									<p>Or pair it with a Shanghainese twist on a croissant, stuffed with yellow croaker and crab roe—an unexpected harmony of sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and umami. This, too, is the taste of life in Shanghai: complex, rich, and deeply satisfying.</p>

									<p>On Huaihai Middle Road, veiled beneath the shadows of plane trees, stands a distinctive white building with a gently blunted corner. Quietly guarding its post for nearly ninety years, this is the iconic Huaihai Building, known affectionately as the “Golden Blunt Corner of Huaihai Road.”</p>
									<p>Originally named Empire Mansions, the building was funded by Zhejiang Industrial Bank and completed in 1934. It is one of the finest examples of modernist architecture in Shanghai’s early 20th-century landscape. The signature V-shaped obtuse corner design not only fits perfectly with the triangular junction of Huaihai and Changshu Roads but has also become a visual anchor of the streetscape.</p>
									<p>Its Art Deco exterior is finished in pristine white paint, adorned with sleek vertical lines that lend a sense of height and elegance. The original blueprints labeled the structure as “Empire Apartments”, suggesting its initial role as upscale residential housing.</p>
									<p>Step inside and you’re transported straight into the 1930s: terrazzo mosaic floors inlaid with brass strips, double-flight staircases with preserved copper railings, and vintage elevators in perfect working order. Even back then, the building boasted hot and cold running water—an extravagant amenity for its time.</p>
									<p>Writer Eileen Chang once captured this lifestyle in her essay “Anecdotes of Apartment Life”, and the Huaihai Building may well have been one of her unspoken inspirations.</p>
									<p>In 1999, it was listed as part of Shanghai’s third group of protected historic buildings. A new phase of restoration began in 2020, focusing on architectural authenticity: all 3,974 steel-framed windows were custom-rebuilt to match the originals, now fitted with double glazing; the street-facing storefronts were set back 50 centimeters to restore the original sawtooth footprint.</p>
									<p>Today, ground-floor shops bustle with activity, while the upper floors remain residential—preserving the 1930s vision of mixed-use urban life. More than just a relic of the former French Concession, the building has witnessed the daily rhythms of several generations of Shanghainese. From 1934 to 2024, the Huaihai Building has remained like a poised lao ke le (old-school gentleman)—graceful, dignified, and unmistakably Shanghai in character. It is a timeless landmark in the city’s cultural memory.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
									<p>Tucked snugly into the building’s iconic corner is Qiao Coffee, a café with a unique pedigree: it’s backed by the century-old state-owned brand Qiaojiashan, famous for traditional Shanghainese pastries. But it’s not just branding that sets Qiao apart. As Li Fangming, the fourth-generation heir of the Qiao family, puts it:</p>
									<p>“We’re not just selling coffee—we’re teaching coffee to speak Shanghainese.”</p>
									<p>This statement is a bold declaration of intent: a heritage brand’s pledge to bridge past and future, fusing time-honored tradition with the tastes of Gen Z. Here, coffee seeps deep into the glutinous layers of the classic ‘Dingsheng Cake’, a poetic collision of East and West—where an imported beverage finally submits to the comforting rhythms of the Shanghainese palate.</p>
									<p>At its heart, Qiao Coffee is a local reimagining of Western coffee culture, framed through the lens of centuries-old Chinese pastry aesthetics. In this café, a cup of coffee might be accompanied by a soft chewy Tiaotou Cakes,or richly savory pork Zongzi,golden flaky crab shell pastries,or glossy bite-sized Qingtuan rice dumplings. Through these pairings, Western ritual meets Chinese flavor, harmonizing in a uniquely Shanghai dialect of taste.</p>

									<p>In the heart of Xujiahui’s bustling commercial hub, two towering Gothic spires pierce the skyline—marking the majestic presence of St. Ignatius Cathedral, often hailed as “the largest church in the Far East.”</p>
									<p>Construction began in 1906 under the design of British architect W. M. Dowdall, and after four years of meticulous work, the cathedral was formally completed on October 22, 1910. Oriented west to east, the church occupies 2,670 square meters of land, with a total floor area of 6,700 square meters. Its two bell towers rise to 56.6 meters, and for many years, they made the church one of the tallest structures in Shanghai—even predating the iconic HSBC building on the Bund in being dubbed “Shanghai’s No. 1 building.”</p>
									<p>Architecturally, the cathedral is a masterpiece. Built in the shape of a Latin cross, it follows the five-aisle basilica layout, with 64 finely carved Jinshan stone clustered columns supporting its vast interior. The rose window on the front façade spans five meters in diameter, flanked by four solemn statues of the Gospel Evangelists. Inside, the soaring vaulted ceiling, rising to 26.6 meters, evokes awe; while the stained-glass windows, restored in 2017, bathe the space in vibrant, prismatic light. The high altar, imported from Paris in 1919, remains intact, adorned with intricate carvings of Jesus and the Virgin Mary—silent witnesses to over a century of change.</p>
									<p>The church holds deep ties with the Xu family, particularly the famed Ming dynasty scientist and Catholic convert Xu Guangqi, revered as one of the “Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism.” The land on which the cathedral stands was donated by his descendants.</p>
									<p>During turbulent decades, the cathedral suffered immense damage: its steeples and crosses were torn down, and the sacred space was repurposed as a fruit warehouse. After being returned to the Church in 1979, the cathedral underwent multiple restorations—the most extensive spanning 2012 to 2018, reviving its former splendor.</p>
									<p>Today, as a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Site, St. Ignatius Cathedral not only serves as the seat of the Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, but also stands as a beloved cultural landmark for locals and tourists alike. On Sundays, the solemn resonance of the pipe organ fills the cathedral: Chinese-language Mass begins at 7:30 a.m., followed by an English Mass at noon, continuing the church’s founding mission of uniting faith across languages and generations.</p>
									<p>In Easter of 2019, a French visitor was stunned to discover a sacred statue donated by his grandfather still resting beside the altar—proof that this cathedral is not just an architectural gem, but a living repository of memory, witnessing Shanghai’s enduring legacy of spiritual and cultural convergence.</p>

									<p>The café’s mascot, Shi Duanzheng, a stylized Chinese stone lion, represents both respect for heritage and a playful push toward youth culture. The shop’s ambiance blends Song dynasty aesthetics with a light retro palette inspired by traditional Chinese design, capturing a new generation’s taste for grace and subtlety.</p>

											<p>Beneath the plane trees of No. 457 Shaanxi North Road, tucked away in quiet shade, stands a garden villa that gracefully blends British grandeur with Eastern elegance—the He Dong Residence.</p>
											<p>Completed in 1928, this historic mansion was once the Shanghai residence of Sir Robert Hotung, then Hong Kong’s wealthiest man. Designed in the style of the English Renaissance, the building stands out as a unique architectural gem in Shanghai. The main house features a pseudo-three-story structure constructed from brick, wood, and stone. Most striking is the Ionic colonnade on the south façade, extending across two floors. Slender columns with delicately carved volutes support the structure, perfectly complemented by wrought-iron balustrades on the curved second-floor balcony. The roughcast stucco walls and bold cornices under wide eaves echo the solemn beauty of 17th-century European architecture.</p>
											<p>In the garden, century-old camphor trees and gnarled vines infuse a touch of Chinese landscape charm, softening the residence’s Western formality. The house once bore witness to the glories of old Shanghai: the Hotung family hosted eminent business figures here, and across the street stood another of their holdings—Peace Garden.</p>
											<p>After 1958, the mansion found a new cultural identity as the editorial home of the Cihai Dictionary, one of modern China’s most authoritative encyclopedic works. Literary giants like Qian Zhongshu once worked at these very desks. Today, the building serves as the office of the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House, still adorned with original parquet floors and carved wooden entryways. The tranquil courtyard and scholarly atmosphere breathe quiet dignity into this storied place, imbuing it with enduring cultural allure.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
											<p>Inside the former Hotung residence now resides Spot Table, the second branch of Coffee Spot. Known for introducing the “coffee set” concept to Shanghai’s café scene, Spot Table curates themed coffee experiences—each set crafted around a central idea and thoughtfully paired with desserts and small bites, creating a holistic sensory experience.</p>
											<p>Set against the backdrop of this Renaissance Revival-style mansion designed by László Hudec, the café is surrounded by expansive green space and ancient trees. Floor-to-ceiling windows open the space to lush garden views, while the natural wood interior creates a warm, artistic atmosphere steeped in serenity.</p>
											<p>Coffee Spot is among the earliest cafés to introduce the “all-in-one set” model into everyday consumption, inspired by the format of World Barista Championships. Their “one bean, three brews” philosophy—offering small pours of black coffee, milk coffee, and a signature drink from the same bean—transforms competition techniques into a menu experience, allowing customers to fully explore the flavor spectrum in a single tasting.</p>

											<p>At the intersection of Maoming South Road and Changle Road in Shanghai stands a building in the Italian Renaissance style, quietly holding its place for nearly a century — the Lyceum Theatre, hailed as the “cradle of Shanghai drama.” This cultural landmark, built in 1931, traces its origins back to 1867, when British expatriates constructed the first Lyceum Theatre. After three relocations and reconstructions, it finally took root at its current site as Shanghai’s earliest Western-style theatre.</p>
											<p>The building itself is a work of art. Its pale-yellow façade is framed by a Corinthian-columned portico, while the interior preserves the lavish glamour of the 1930s: plush red velvet seats in the second-floor boxes, gilded ornamental railings, and a dome adorned with exquisite frescoes. Most remarkable of all, the theatre still retains its original stage machinery — 25 electrically powered fly bars that can be positioned at will, once considered the most advanced stage equipment in Asia. The original design, as legend has it, was casually sketched by a British architect over afternoon tea, yet it resulted in an enduring architectural classic.</p>
											<p>The Lyceum has borne witness to the birth and growth of modern Chinese theatre. In 1907, the Chunyang Society premiered Uncle Tom’s Cabin here, China’s very first spoken drama. In 1934, Cao Yu’s Thunderstorm debuted to great acclaim. In 1945, Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang returned to the stage after an eight-year hiatus during the war, premiering the Kunqu opera The Tiger Slayer. After the founding of the People’s Republic, the theatre was renamed the Shanghai Art Theatre and became home to the Shanghai People’s Art Theatre, staging countless classics. In 1960, Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai attended a performance of the dance drama The Small Sword Society here. In 1983, the Lyceum launched special performances for foreign audiences, introducing traditional Chinese culture to the world. Following a full restoration in 2003, the theatre reopened, retaining 250 “tea seats” — complete with small tables — among its 466 seats, preserving the old Shanghai tradition of sipping tea while enjoying a play.</p>
											<p>Today, at 91 years old, the Lyceum remains at the forefront of the arts. From traditional drama to modern musicals, from classical concerts to experimental theatre, it continues to be a melting pot of artistic expression. When night falls and the theatre’s neon lights flicker on, the glow seems to bridge time, merging with the dazzling nightlife of 1930s Shanghai — a city whose art never takes its final bow.</p>

											<p>Step out of the Lyceum Theatre, turn onto Changle Road, and just a few paces away you’ll find Onirii Coffee.From Nanchang Road to Jinxian Road to its current spot on Changle Road, Onirii has moved three times. Its weathered blue storefront and discreet, small-lettered sign make it an understated but distinctive presence.</p>
											<p>The shop even draws the likes of James Freeman — clarinet enthusiast and founder of Blue Bottle Coffee — proof of the kinship that exists among those deeply devoted to the craft of coffee.</p>

											<p>Inspired by Greek gods, Onirii’s creations unfold in layers of flavor, like slipping into a dream both heady and vivid. Within this small haven, coffee is no longer just a drink — it’s a bridge between people, and between a person and themselves. In the soft curl of coffee’s aroma, what we find is more than taste: we discover memory, aesthetics, and emotional resonance.</p>
											<p>P.S. By day it’s coffee, by night it’s wine — two pleasures, one space.</p>

											<p>At No. 1262 Yan’an West Road, a striking Spanish-style complex continues to write its century-spanning legend. Originally built in 1924 as the Columbia Country Club, it has since been reborn as “The Columbia Circle” (上生新所)—a creative landmark and cultural hub for Shanghai’s artistic youth.</p>
											<p>Strolling through the compound, the outdoor swimming pool, remarkably well preserved, captures the eye. Built in 1925 as part of the U.S. Navy Club, the pool is lined with blue mosaic tiles, and its tranquil waters reflect the white colonnades around it—evoking a frozen moment of Mediterranean sunlight in Shanghai. Once the social heart of Shanghai’s American expatriates, the pool hosted swimming sailors and glamorous poolside dances. Fascinatingly, the original changing rooms and diving platform remain intact—though now repurposed into a fashion runway and beer garden.</p>
											<p>The main clubhouse, designed by famed Hungarian architect László Hudec, stands alongside the Sun Ke Villa—the former residence of Sun Yat-sen’s son—together forming one of Shanghai’s rare examples of Spanish Revival architecture. With red-tiled roofs, arched windows and doors, and wrought-iron balconies, every detail speaks to the opulence of the 1920s.</p>
											<p>In 2020, Japan’s Tsutaya Bookstore opened its first China flagship here, bringing a breathtaking fusion of historic architecture and literary modernity. The bookstore lovingly preserves original features like the fireplace, Corinthian columns, and mosaic flooring, inviting readers to lose themselves in books surrounded by heritage.</p>
											<p>Spanning 32,000 square meters, the site hides many layers of history: in 1951, it became the Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, contributing to China’s early vaccine research. In 2016, real estate developer Vanke led a sensitive renovation, breathing new life into the old structures—the former boiler room became an art space, the laboratories transformed into creative studios, and even the old smokestack is now a photogenic landmark.</p>
											<p>On weekends, the area bustles with poolside markets, contemporary art exhibitions in historic buildings, and an effortless fusion of old and new. From elite expat social club to vaccine lab to today’s cultural destination, the Columbia Country Club’s century-long transformation is a living metaphor for Shanghai’s urban evolution. As the setting sun gilds the Spanish arcades, and laughter rises around the pool, it’s easy to imagine the echoes of 1920s jazz dancing through the air—proof that this city’s charm never fades.</p>

											<p>Among the many gems inside Columbia Circle is Shardaa, a coffee shop rooted in Tibetan culture. Founded in 2021, Shardaa originated from the Himalayas as a rising brand dedicated to merging Tibetan lifestyle wisdom with modern design. Through coffee, it shares and celebrates Tibetan culture.</p>
											<p>The café’s interior bursts with bold colors and rich ethnic textures, immersing guests in an atmosphere of authentic Tibetan aesthetics. Beyond serving coffee, Shardaa also displays and sells Tibetan carpets, textiles, and household crafts, adding depth and story to the space.</p>
											<p>The drinks menu features innovative takes on Tibetan beverages—including barley wine-flavored specialty coffee and Tibetan milk tea infusions. Even the cups and utensils are infused with cultural identity, using Tibetan script and motifs to express the uniqueness of the region.</p>
											<p>In Tibetan, “Shardaa” means “Cheers,” symbolizing joy, connection, celebration, and blessing. More than just a café, Shardaa is a cultural showcase, a platform bringing Tibetan culture beyond the plateau, fostering exchange and artistic exploration in a vibrant, contemporary setting.</p>

											<p>Changde Apartments, originally named Eddington Apartments, is located at 195 Changde Road, Shanghai. Built in 1936, Unit 65 on the 6th floor was Eileen Chang’s residence from 1942 to 1947. Designed by an Italian architect, the building features a reinforced concrete structure in the Art Deco style. Its pale pink exterior walls and curved balconies give it a distinctive charm. Despite standing for nearly a century, it still retains its dignity.</p>
											<p>In that era, high-rise apartments were springing up in the heart of the concessions, and Changde Apartments was one of them. The building’s floor plan is shaped like a concave “凹,” with three units per floor, available in two- and three-bedroom layouts. The 8-story building had wooden floors throughout, fireplaces and radiators in the rooms, small dressing rooms and en-suite bathrooms in the bedrooms, kitchens arranged along the west-facing outer corridor, rear balconies, and separate bathrooms for maids on each floor.</p>
											<p>In the summer of 1942, Eileen Chang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and moved into Unit 65 on the 6th floor with her aunt, formally beginning her life as an “apartment writer.” It was here that she completed Love in a Fallen City, Aloeswood Incense – The First Brazier, Aloeswood Incense – The Second Brazier, The Golden Cangue, and Sealed Off. This was the most brilliant period of her life.</p>
											<p>The first time Hu Lancheng visited Eileen Chang was here. Taking the elevator up to the 6th floor, he was astonished by the elegance of her apartment. Beyond the balcony stretched all of Shanghai, bathed in drifting clouds and sunlight, while trams clanged back and forth below. Eileen Chang wrote about the many struggles and confrontations between men and women living in the city, creating deeply nuanced characters—yet in her own life, she entrusted herself to the wrong person.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
											<p>A Coffee Under Eileen Chang’s Apartment — Eileen Books</p>
											<p>Today, the building remains a residential property, but on the ground floor, Qian Cai Bookshop serves as a memorial to Eileen Chang, attracting literature lovers from near and far. This Eileen Chang–themed café and bookstore, facing the street, once inspired Shanghai writer Wang Anno (elder sister of Wang Anyi) to write about her quiet visit there.</p>
											<p>The shop’s English name, Eileen Books, echoes Eileen Chang’s own name. The aroma of coffee, mingled with the scent of books, grows richer here, and the thick air of nostalgia makes it an ideal place for book lovers to remember her.</p>
											<p>What makes it special is its creative pairing of coffee designs with Eileen Chang’s novels. On a quiet afternoon, sitting by the window with a book in hand and sipping a coffee inspired by a story is a uniquely sensory experience. Red Rose Latte, Love in a Fallen City, Half a Lifelong Romance, Eighteen Springs, Love in the Red Land, Reunion, Traces of Love Lost—each cup is a taste of a past moment, a fragment of an old story.</p>

											<p>Denis Apartments Located at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Shimen Second Road, Denis Apartments was one of Shanghai’s earliest apartment buildings to feature dormitories for single tenants. Built in 1930, it was invested in by Denis Chen (Cheng Yize) and designed by the British firm Cumine & Milne, with construction carried out by Kung Yee & Co.</p>
											<p>In 1927, Denis Chen established the Youyou Sports Association, inviting expatriates, stationed troops, and teams from Hong Kong, Malaysia, and elsewhere to compete in tournaments. To solve the accommodation problem for the 300-plus participants, he decided to construct a building at the corner of Carter Road and Jing’an Temple Road. The building was named after himself—Denis Apartments, while its Chinese name, 德义大楼, also carried the meaning of “virtue and righteousness.”</p>
											<p>After 1931, the Cheng family went bankrupt, and the building was sold to the Bank of China. The bank modified the internal structure and used it as employee housing. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the building came under the ownership of the Shanghai municipal government, though many bank employees and their families continued to live there. In 1994, the building was listed as part of Shanghai’s second batch of Outstanding Historical Buildings.</p>
											<p>Denis Apartments stands 10 stories tall, reaching 39.7 meters, with a total floor area of 11,774 square meters. Built with reinforced concrete, it features three elevators and a central heating system. Its Art Deco style includes mosaic-floored corridors, a curved main façade clad in brown refractory kaolin bricks—making it one of the first buildings in Shanghai to use such a finish—and a secondary façade of textured cement enlivened by slightly different shades of brick. To maximize land use, the building adopted a perimeter-block layout, renting out the ground-floor street-facing units to shops for significant rental income.</p>

											<p>At this intersection, when it comes to coffee, whether it’s local boutique cafés, authentic Italian espresso bars, or Japanese-style artisan brewers, few can rival the dominating presence of the Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Once the largest Starbucks in Asia, its scale and influence are comparable to the original Pike Place Market store in Seattle—undisputed landmarks in Starbucks’ history. Since its opening, it has drawn endless visitors and retained its position as a sales champion. Recently, with the arrival of the massive Louis Vuitton “boat” installation across the street, the Roastery has found itself back in the spotlight, the two forming an iconic standoff that draws throngs to the Taikoo Hui commercial district.</p>
											<p>The Roastery has been in operation in Shanghai for nearly eight years, occupying an enormous 2,700-square-meter space with its unique double-tailed siren entrance. This distinctive emblem draws inspiration from the Greek mythological figure Poseidon, exuding both mystery and an adventurous spirit. Designed as a “front shop, back workshop,” the store integrates the entire coffee lifecycle into its space—from bean sorting and bagging to the roasting process—allowing customers to witness each stage firsthand.</p>
											<p>Through strategic brand positioning and savvy commercial placement, Starbucks has won over Shanghai’s coffee market, turning the Roastery into far more than just a place to drink coffee. It serves as a coffee culture education hub, a leisure and entertainment venue, a modern tourist attraction, and a multifaceted urban landmark.</p>

										<p>Yates Apartments, originally the China Bank West District Branch and later renamed Wujiang Building, sits at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Shimen 1st Road, diagonally across from the Denis Apartments.</p>
										<p>Built in 1935 by the Bank of China, it took its original name from Tongfu Road (now Shimen 1st Road) where it stood. Designed by Lu Qianshou and Wu Jingqi, and constructed by Dachang Construction Company, the building was completed in 1936. Initially serving as the Bank of China’s West District Branch, its ground floor today houses the ICBC Jing’an Shimen 1st Road Sub-branch. In 1994, the Tongfu Building was included in Shanghai’s second batch of Excellent Historical Buildings.</p>
										<p>The Tongfu Building is a semi-circular nine-story apartment block, 34.45 meters tall, with a floor area of 2,887 square meters and an elevator. Built in the Modernist style with a reinforced concrete structure, its deep brown facing bricks and façade emphasize strong horizontal lines. Flanked on three sides by roads—Nanjing West Road, Shimen 1st Road, and Wujiang Road—the building sits on a corner plot and adopts a point-layout design, maximizing floor area despite the cramped site. Upon completion, the ground floor and basement were used by the Bank of China, while floors two through nine were rental apartments—one two-bedroom, one three-bedroom, and one four-bedroom per floor. At the time, its compact units drew criticism for being cramped. Today, however, this adaptive, site-specific form has made the century-old building an unusually eye-catching landmark.</p>

										<p>From the blooming Gucci Garden to Dior Café at Qiantan, Tiffany’s afternoon tea to the massive Louis Vuitton flagship, the path finally leads to the IWC Big Pilot Bar.</p>
										<p>In recent years, luxury brands have been diversifying aggressively into dining, with coffee and desserts emerging as the hottest arena. More and more brands are exploring how to fuse their signature identity with dining culture, giving customers a dining experience like no other.</p>
										<p>Coffee, as one of the most accessible touchpoints between the fast-moving consumer market and modern lifestyles, offers the quickest way to gauge contemporary tastes, break cultural barriers, and blend seamlessly into local ways of living.</p>
										<p>For luxury brands, venturing into coffee is not only a shortcut to building deep, multidimensional connections with high-end consumers and boosting sales—it’s also a marketing tool for promoting the high-end lifestyle, a way to export a brand’s rich and diverse cultural narrative.</p>
										<p>By weaving coffee into the brand experience, reshaping communication content, and creating social-media-friendly destinations, these cafés generate powerful storytelling value. They help brands reach new audiences, draw in more foot traffic, break through cultural “bubbles,” and—most importantly—win over younger consumers in a fresh, approachable way.</p>

										<p>Park Hotel, located at the corner of West Nanjing Road and Huanghe Road, was completed in 1934. It was one of Shanghai’s most famous hotels from the 1930s to 1940s, serving as a city landmark and the origin point of Shanghai’s urban coordinate system. Since its completion, the building’s interior décor has undergone multiple renovations, and ownership has changed hands. On May 25, 2006, the Park Hotel was designated a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Unit.</p>
										<p>In May 1930, the Joint Savings Society—formed by the Continental Bank, Salt Industry Bank, China & South Sea Bank, and Kincheng Bank—purchased a plot of land opposite the Shanghai Racecourse for 450,000 taels of silver. Their ambition was to construct the tallest building in Asia, a symbol of their financial strength. Hungarian architect László Hudec led the design, with his brother György Hudec also contributing. Initially planned as an apartment building, Hudec suggested converting it into a luxury hotel. Wu Shoulian, then regional sales manager of the American Motors Company for the Far East, also argued that a luxury hotel would be more profitable. The Society agreed, and the plan was changed.</p>
										<p>Construction was undertaken by the Danish firm Carl Konigsfeld & Co., with Qiaxing Construction responsible for the two basement levels and Fook Kee Construction winning the bid for the above-ground structure. The building was completed in June 1934 and opened to the public, known also as the Joint Savings Society Building. Upon completion, it surpassed the Sassoon House to become the tallest building in Shanghai, China, and indeed all of Asia—earning the title “The Tallest Building in the Far East.”</p>

											<p>Grand Cinema Located at 216 West Nanjing Road, the Grand Cinema is one of the oldest surviving cinemas in China, first built in 1928 and once hailed as the “Number One Cinema in the Far East.” It was founded by Teochew businessman Gao Yongqing, who, together with foreign investors, converted the Carlton Dance Hall on Jing’an Temple Road into a cinema named “Grand Cinema.” At the time, it featured a tea room, wine bar, smoking lounge, and waiting area. On December 23, 1928, Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang personally cut the ribbon for its grand opening.</p>
											<p>In 1930, the cinema screened the American film Not Afraid to Die, which contained anti-Chinese content. Public outrage and boycotts forced it to close. In 1933, Hungarian architect László Hudec was commissioned to completely redesign the cinema. With its luxurious facilities, the rebuilt Grand Cinema regained its title as the most prestigious theater in the Far East. In 1989, it was listed as a Shanghai Cultural Heritage Site.</p>
											<p>In 2008, the building underwent a 120-million-yuan restoration to return it to its 1933 glory. While its original 1,900-seat hall was reduced by over 600 seats, the two-tier auditorium layout remained.</p>
											<p>Before the liberation of Shanghai, Hollywood studios dominated the city’s film market, and the Grand mainly screened productions from America’s “Big Eight” studios. The first domestic film it ever screened was The Legend of the Red Sheep Hero by Xinhua Film Company. The Grand was also China’s first widescreen cinema and the first stereo sound cinema, and it held the top spot in Shanghai’s box office rankings for 11 consecutive years — witnessing the rise and fall of Chinese cinema.</p>

											<p>During the Shanghai International Film Festival, coffee added another layer of delight. The Grand teamed up with the third-floor Midnight Café to launch a Film Festival Signature Stamped Coffee — just show two movie tickets to get a cup for only 9.9 yuan.</p>
											<p>On one side, the century-old Grand Cinema carries the cinematic memories of generations. On the other, the Midnight Café serves up atmosphere and flavor, blending film culture with coffee in a dreamy collaboration. The coffee comes topped with a custom logo in delicate milk foam, and the special recipe incorporates both the festival’s spirit and the Grand’s own heritage. One sip, and the taste is steeped in cinematic culture.</p>
											<p>Find a window seat overlooking the bustling Nanjing Road, and let the moment linger. This pop-up coffee is only available during the festival, so keep an eye on Grand Cinema’s posters — you won’t want to miss next year’s special brew.</p>

										<p>Trinity Church Shanghai — this “Red Chapel” standing in the Bund’s historic district bears witness to the sweeping changes since Shanghai first opened its port. Originally built in 1847 by early British expatriates to meet their religious needs, it was one of the city’s earliest Christian churches. After the original building was damaged, it was rebuilt in 1869 at its present location (219 Jiujiang Road). Designed in the Gothic Revival style popular in Britain, its distinctive exposed red-brick façade soon gained fame, becoming a landmark example of modern Chinese red-brick architecture. The 54-meter bell tower added in 1893 once stood as the tallest point in Shanghai, overlooking the bustling banks of the Huangpu River.</p>
										<p>Its fate, however, rose and fell with the tides of history. The 20th century brought war and turmoil; during the Cultural Revolution in 1966, the church’s exquisite stained-glass windows were smashed, the bell tower’s spire was forcibly removed, and its interior suffered heavy damage—stripping it of its former glory. Thankfully, its value was never forgotten. Designated a Shanghai Cultural Heritage Site, it underwent a decade-long restoration in the early 21st century, with significant funding from the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Church). Guided by the principle of “restoring the old as it was,” the project culminated in 2019 with the successful reconstruction of the bell tower spire and the meticulous repair of its red-brick façade, stone carvings, and stained glass.</p>
										<p>In 2023, this long-slumbering architectural gem awoke to new life. Today, it serves not only as a venue for English-language worship services but also—via appointment-based visits—as a public showcase of Gothic design and exceptional acoustics. A cultural landmark where faith, history, and architectural artistry converge, it silently tells the epic story of Shanghai’s journey from its treaty port beginnings to its modern renaissance.</p>

										<p>The Press Café at the Former Shen Bao Building — Standing at the corner of Hankou Road, this café occupies the original site of Shen Bao, one of China’s most influential newspapers. Founded in 1872, Shen Bao chronicled colonial history and etched the memories of the Republic of China era. The building’s exterior façade remains intact, while the interior preserves numerous historical details—including a photo history wall, ornate coffered ceilings, and even menus styled after the original newspaper.</p>
										<p>Another nostalgic draw lies in the building’s pop-culture footprint—it was a filming location for Romance in the Rain (Qing Shen Shen Yu Meng Meng), a landmark Qiong Yao drama at the turn of the 21st century. The series holds a significance in Chinese-language media far beyond its romantic plot—it served as a mirror of a society in cultural transition, a catalyst for female consciousness, and an influence on the aesthetics of the television industry. Today, it remains a beloved pilgrimage site for viewers who grew up with Qiong Yao’s works. Sit down with a coffee and a slice of cake, and when the background music swells with “Qing Shen Shen Yu Meng Meng…”, you’ll feel a wave of nostalgia rush over you.</p>

											<p>Shanghai Great World, once hailed as the “No. 1 Amusement Park in the Far East,” is a legendary landmark of modern Shanghai’s popular entertainment scene. It was founded in 1917 by the prominent Shanghai businessman Huang Chujiu, right by the bustling foot of the Tibet South Road Bridge. From day one, its opening slogan—“Play all day without spending a penny”—caused a citywide sensation.</p>
											<p>Inside its unique Chinese–Western fusion building were the Qian Kun Grand Theatre, a cinema, variety stages, storytelling halls, Chinese and Western restaurants, and small shops—like a kaleidoscope of amusements under one roof. Day and night, the stages came alive with Peking Opera, Yue Opera, magic shows, slapstick comedy, and other “hundred plays” of the Shanghai style. The Hall of Funhouse Mirrors became especially famous, making the Great World a “kingdom of joy” for young and old alike.</p>
											<p>In 1931, after Huang’s death, the property was purchased by the famed Shanghai tycoon Huang Jinrong and briefly renamed Rong’s Great World, continuing to shape the city’s entertainment trends.</p>
											<p>After 1949, Great World went through major changes. In 1954, the government took over and ran it as the Shanghai People’s Amusement Park. In 1966, with the start of the Cultural Revolution, it was forced to close. By 1974, the building had been repurposed as the Shanghai Youth Palace, stripping away much of its entertainment flair.</p>
											<p>It wasn’t until 1987, in the wake of China’s reform and opening up, that the “Great World” name returned, reopening as a comprehensive amusement center. The funhouse mirrors and folk performances brought back waves of nostalgia. But in the face of new entertainment trends, it gradually fell silent after 2003.</p>
											<p>In 2017, on its centennial anniversary, Great World was reborn with a new mission: to showcase and keep alive intangible cultural heritage. The recreated Hall of Mirrors still draws laughter, while the space has been transformed into a stage and interactive venue for traditional opera, folk music, and crafts. From a modern-age carnival for the masses to today’s “living museum” of cultural memory, Great World has weathered a century of ups and downs—remaining a vivid symbol of Shanghai’s entertainment DNA and the imprint of its times.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
											<p>From Great World, it’s just a short walk to the intersection of Weihai Road and Huangpi Road, where you’ll find Shiteng Coffee—a café championing creative, cross-genre collaborations that make coffee endlessly playful.</p>
											<p>Its signature Soy Sauce Latte has been a bestseller for years, served from a traditional soy sauce vat. The salty-savory notes blend into the latte’s smoothness, leaving a sweet aftertaste. Another standout is the Coffee Rice, a steaming earthen pot of latte-infused broth with roasted brown rice and seaweed—a uniquely Shanghai-style coffee comfort dish, deeply “coffee” yet unmistakably “Shanghai.”</p>
											<p>If the sunlight is just right, sit at a table by the doorway or the windowsill, sipping your coffee rice. You might suddenly recall the shikumen houses of your childhood, as the vintage flavors rise in the air.</p>

											<p>On the southwest corner of Nanjing West Road and Shaanxi Road stands a historic building that has carried Shanghai’s memory for nearly a century.</p>
											<p>In 1925, the Sassoon Company commissioned architect László Hudec to design the Peace Building—a seven-story Art Deco structure clad in cream-colored tiles with vertical lines like a ship sailing into the wind. From the rooftop terraces, one could overlook the grand Shanghai Racecourse. It was once a prestigious residence for Shanghai’s elite, with the ground-floor Kaisiling Café perfuming the air for thirty years. Writer Eileen Chang even used it as inspiration for the “Peace Mansion” in her novella Lust, Caution.</p>
											<p>In 1951, the neighboring lot—formerly the mansion of Jewish tycoon Soong Fook—was converted into the Peace Theatre, Shanghai’s first widescreen cinema, which drew huge crowds. In 1972, its distinctive wave-shaped awning was added, becoming an icon of the era. Together, the commercial–residential Peace Building and the cultural–entertainment Peace Theatre became sister landmarks of the neighborhood.</p>
											<p>By the 1990s, the cinema had declined and was eventually demolished (in 2012, its site became the Vacheron Constantin House). The Peace Building itself survived thanks to a 1993 conservation project, preserving Hudec’s curved corner façade and dark-brown window frames.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="content-k2" style="display: none;">
											<p>Not far away, Foule Coffee—marked by its signature coffee balloon—has landed opposite Prada Rong Zhai on the Shaanxi North Road stretch of Nanjing West Road. This once-traditional shopping street has welcomed a new emblem of Shanghai coffee culture, making every city walk more flavorful.</p>
											<p>The owner, a Shanghai-born “uncle,” insists on using a uniquely Chinese technique: dùn—a slow, double-boiling method for preparing coffee concentrate (there’s no direct equivalent in English cooking terms). The result is smooth, mild, pure, and balanced—“subtle yet not bland”—echoing the gentle, nourishing quality of Chinese tea. It’s easy to accept, needs no specialized equipment, and can be made at home. The concentrate stays stable whether chilled, reheated, or taken to-go, making it suitable for frequent, large servings without losing quality.</p>
											<p>Chinese-style coffee even has its own English name now: Cinesso (沁漺), filling the gap in the world’s coffee landscape with a Chinese contribution. Popular menu items include Yogurt Coffee, Rice Fragrance Coffee, and Alley Milk Cappuccino—all brimming with rich, localized charm.</p>

										<p>Shanghai Workers’ Cultural Palace, located at 120 Middle Tibet Road, is a nine-story building that once bore the name “Eastern Hotel” and witnessed the bustling international scene of Shanghai’s famed “Ten-Mile Foreign Street.” Designed and completed in 1929 by Hungarian architect László Hudec, its Neoclassical façade features vertical lines like the strings of a grand piano, while the glass spire atop lit up the night sky over the racecourse in the 1930s. Inside, exquisite details like the stained-glass dome, bronze revolving doors, and marble staircases silently tell tales of colonial-era luxury.</p>
										<p>A historic turning point came in 1950 when Mayor Chen Yi renamed it the “Home of Workers,” with Mao Zedong’s inscription “School and Paradise for Workers” carved at the entrance hall. The renovated octagonal auditorium became a spiritual sanctuary for the working class. Model worker report meetings and technical innovation exhibitions sparked vibrant exchanges of ideas. The theater regularly staged era-defining plays like “From a Silent Place,” while the rooftop observatory unveiled the cosmos to workers’ children.</p>
										<p>After the 1990s, the “City Palace” evolved into a diverse cultural space: the Jasmine Flower Theater was revived, ping-pong balls flew in the table tennis room, and golden medals in the model worker exhibition shimmered alongside the 1929 stained-glass dome.</p>
										<p>A 2019 renovation reignited the building’s original spirit: Hudec’s signature octagonal window frames glow with a new light, while behind the red velvet curtains echo both dramatic lines and cheers from e-sports youth. From the jazz echoes of a colonial hotel to the resolute shine of worker badges, this crossroads building proves after ninety years that a true palace ultimately belongs to the people.</p>

										<p>Marmalade, a coffee shop shaking up Shanghai’s coffee scene with its boldly innovative “Venom Coffee,” is a sister store to Orange on Fumin Road—hence the fitting name inspired by orange marmalade.</p>
										<p>With a wood-toned design, its storefront is understated yet rich in detail. The intimate layout offers a long bar by the window for solo sippers and cozy four-person corners perfect for private chats.</p>
										<p>Their signature “Venom” blends homemade liquor-infused syrup with the rich warmth of whiskey, finishing with a lively citrus kick.</p>
										<p>As a socially responsible café actively promoting community culture, Marmalade regularly hosts cross-disciplinary collaborations with local artists and runs ongoing coffee tasting salons.</p>

										<p>Standing at the intersection of East Nanjing Road and Middle Zhejiang Road, Shanghai First Department Store is itself a living epic of Nanjing Road’s commercial history. Founded and opened in 1936 by overseas Chinese businessman Cai Chang, it was originally called the “Da Xin Company” and proudly stood alongside the four major foreign department stores as a symbol of Chinese commercial strength.</p>
										<p>This seven-story Art Deco masterpiece was designed by the Chinese architectural firm Kitai Engineering. Its beige brick façade is inset with dark tall windows, topped by a distinctive Chinese-style glazed tile pavilion—ushering in a “modern Chinese style” for commercial architecture. Inside, four of Asia’s first Otis escalators spiral upward through a lofty atrium, while glass display cases showcase Parisian perfumes alongside Suzhou silk, and the rooftop amusement area called the “Sixteen Views on the Roof” attracted fashionable crowds who lingered late into the night.</p>
										<p>Renamed “First Department Store” in 1953, the escalators gave way to symbols of planned economy life—glass display counters featuring permanent-issue bicycles and Butterfly brand sewing machines. Cloth and grain ration tickets changed hands amidst the clicking of abacuses, while the top-floor exhibition hall became a spiritual hall decorated with photos of model workers and red flag awards.</p>
										<p>After a 2017 renovation by RuEn Design Studio, a brilliant “time-space corridor” was created connecting the old and new buildings: on one side, the original 1936 terrazzo escalator, on the other, a mirrored VR shopping screen. This transformation exemplifies how historic buildings can be culturally anchored in urban development, balancing old and new to preserve unique charm. Urban renewal need not mean wholesale demolition and reconstruction but can instead rejuvenate historic architecture while honoring its roots.</p>

										<p>Every corner of ROASTELIER exudes rich coffee aroma, instantly putting visitors at ease. The shop’s minimalist yet elegant design combines wood tones and soft lighting, creating the feel of a warm coffee forest. Each coffee bean is freshly roasted right before your eyes, infusing every cup with subtle sweetness. The delicate aroma from the Maillard reaction awakens your passion for coffee in an instant.</p>

										<p>Located at No. 722 West Nanjing Road, this building is an outstanding historic structure carrying significant historical memories. Constructed around 1911 (some say the 1920s), it was designed by Austrian architect Hans Kohn in an eclectic classical style. The façade is dignified and elegant, blending elements of Neoclassicism with the Vienna Secession movement. Originally, it served as the clubhouse for the Jiangwan Racecourse—also known as the Jiangwan Jockey Club or the International Sports Club—operated by Ye Yiquan, the fourth son of wealthy Shanghai merchant Ye Chengzhong. Later, it housed the Jewish General Assembly and the U.S. Fourth Marine Division Club. After 1949, it was used as the office for Shanghai’s Political Consultative Conference and the Shanghai Overseas Friendship Association, and today it serves as the headquarters of the Chunlan Group.</p>
										<p>The Shanghai Jewish community, primarily Sephardic Jews, was relatively small but economically strong. Their main focus was charitable relief, founding the Shanghai Jewish Holy Society to carry out this work. In 1934, the society established a hospital to aid Jews living in Shanghai.</p>
										<p>This building was the social and cultural hub for German-Jewish émigrés in Shanghai. It featured well-equipped facilities including a famous rooftop garden restaurant and dance hall, an auditorium, library, card room, bar, and dining rooms. It became a unique social landmark in Shanghai and a spiritual sanctuary for European Jewish refugees, earning the nickname “Little Vienna.”</p>

										<p>Le Café Louis Vuitton, located in Shanghai’s Xintiandi Taikoo Hui, is far more than just a coffee shop. It marks a strategic milestone for the luxury giant in breaking industry boundaries and creating an immersive lifestyle kingdom.</p>
										<p>As an innovative extension of brand experience, Louis Vuitton’s first global café and restaurant goes beyond merely selling products. It creates a space where visitors can rest, socialize, and “live” within the brand’s aesthetic. Guests don’t have to buy leather goods to effortlessly immerse themselves in LV’s carefully crafted “luxury atmosphere” through a cup of coffee or a dessert, experiencing its travel culture, French elegance, and exquisite design reflected in the tableware, furniture, and even the desserts themselves.</p>
										<p>Designed by LV’s signature architect Peter Marino, the shop itself is a work of art. Its iconic color palette, magnificent chandeliers, and art-grade décor perfectly embody the brand’s high aesthetic. It’s more than a café—it’s a boutique luxury art gallery and social landmark, strengthening consumers’ deep emotional connection to the brand culture.</p>
										<p>Le Café Louis Vuitton represents the luxury industry’s profound shift toward the “experience economy.” It demonstrates how brands can forge enduring, multi-dimensional emotional bonds with customers by creating high-end lifestyle scenarios, transforming fleeting purchases into lifelong lifestyle affiliations. This blend of retail, dining, and cultural arts redefines the boundaries of luxury consumption, injecting cutting-edge commercial inspiration into Shanghai’s status as an international consumer hub. It symbolizes how top-tier luxury no longer merely adorns the exterior but strives to permeate the refined daily life of the modern city.</p>

										<p>Ohel Rachel Synagogue (西摩会堂旧址), located at No. 500 Shaanxi North Road (near West Nanjing Road), was built in 1920 by the Sephardic Jewish community in Shanghai, mainly English-Iraqi Jews. It is the oldest and most architecturally exquisite surviving Jewish synagogue in Shanghai, and one of the most important Jewish religious and community centers in the Far East before World War II. Today, it serves as the office for the Jing’an District Education Bureau and is listed as a National Key Cultural Relics Protection Unit.</p>
										<p>The building is a prime example of Neoclassical and Romanesque Revival architecture, with a dignified and elegant red brick façade, delicate window decorations, and once featured a distinctive dome on its roof (later damaged and not rebuilt). Inside, it originally housed a magnificent carved ceiling, stained glass windows, and a beautifully crafted bimah (reading platform), showcasing the peak of Shanghai’s architectural design and craftsmanship at the time.</p>
										<p>During World War II, it became a religious and spiritual refuge for the influx of European Jewish refugees, bearing witness to Shanghai’s humanitarian role as the “Eastern Noah’s Ark.” In 2001, it received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Cultural Heritage Conservation Award.</p>
										<p>While the synagogue now functions as an administrative office, its core structural and external appearance remain strictly preserved. Unfortunately, it is not open to the public for visits or photography. The original religious spaces have been partially modified to suit office needs, but as a world-class Jewish cultural heritage site and a vital physical testimony to human migration and tragedy, it stands not only as an outstanding historic building but also as an important monument to Shanghai’s multicultural and inclusive spirit and global anti-fascist history.</p>

										<p>Along Shaanxi North Road, numerous intriguing small shops beckon passersby. Just a few dozen meters south of Ohel Moishe, on the first floor of Taiping Garden, is WHOOPSO – 叹所, a coffee shop notable for its slide-like seating that invites visitors to explore coffee in a playful way. WHOOPSO defines its philosophy as a “taste laboratory,” constantly experimenting to find balance between ideals and reality through coffee, bread, desserts, and sandwiches. The owner—a former graphic designer—has installed a vintage Heidelberg printing press as a signature piece, reflecting an industrial and retro aesthetic throughout the space.</p>
										<p>The shop’s limited-edition signature coffee highlights the true essence of the bean—light, bright acidity or rich, bold intensity—each worthy of savoring. Baking plays an indispensable role: the aroma of butter fills the air, the warmth fresh from the oven, the crispy crust shedding crumbs—a comforting carbohydrate happiness.</p>
										<p>In the bustle of daily life, finding such a tranquil retreat to sip slowly in a building full of stories might just be the most luxurious everyday experience.</p>

											<p>Wukang Mansion (formerly Normandy Apartments), majestically standing at No. 1850 Middle Huaihai Road, resembles a mighty ship cutting through the unique triangular intersection formed by Wukang Road, Xingguo Road, Huaihai Road, Tianping Road, and Yuqing Road. As one of Shanghai’s most iconic historic landmarks, it was designed by the Hungarian architect László Hudec and constructed from 1924 to 1929, funded by the International Savings Society. It ranks among Shanghai’s earliest external corridor apartment buildings and is recognized as an Outstanding Historical Building of Shanghai.</p>
											<p>The mansion’s distinctive French Renaissance style, blended with Art Deco elements, features a clean ochre-red façade, a tripartite composition, and continuous arc-shaped external corridors (later partially enclosed for practicality), stunning all who behold it. Taking full advantage of the site’s 30° angled plot, the building forms a solemn sharp bow shape. Vertical classical arches, horizontal transparent long balconies, and floral decorations crowning the roof together sketch a grand yet elegant rhythm of Southern European architecture.</p>
											<p>Upon completion, it became a prestigious residence known as the “International Apartments,” hosting a distinguished mix of European and American politicians, businessmen, film stars, and cultural figures. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, prominent artists such as Zhao Dan and Wang Renmei became notable residents. Having withstood nearly a century of change, Wukang Mansion stands not only as a witness to the golden era of the French Concession but also as a carrier of Shanghai’s modern urban transformation memories.</p>
											<p>In the early 21st century, meticulous restoration revived its original appearance. The ground floor welcomed cultural and artistic uses, transforming the building from a closed residence into a “three-dimensional museum” of urban culture and life. At sunset, when the “ship’s bow” glows with golden light, Wukang Mansion transcends its identity as mere architecture to become a symbol of Shanghai’s cosmopolitan elegance and enduring spirit, telling the world stories of the city’s openness and timeless charm.</p>

										<p>The Cottage Cafe (老麦咖啡馆), Shanghai’s earliest vintage café, began in 2009 on Taojiang Road and relocated in 2018 to the Wukang Road location, becoming a paradise for retro lovers. Complementing the timeworn aura of Wukang Mansion, the café’s façade blends French and industrial styles. Facing a side with limited sunlight, it compensates with nine large windows that not only brighten the interior but also offer a long row of street-view seats for guests who love city scenes.</p>
										<p>Owner “Old Mike” (老Mike) treats the café as an anthropological archive, distilling over fifty years of Shanghai life memory into this space: the vintage postman’s lamp hanging over the door, the worm-eaten teakwood bar, a medicine cabinet rescued from demolition rubble, and warmly patinated old leather chairs. Each antique piece feels like a museum exhibit with its own story, collectively evoking memories of Shanghai’s lane life and blending perfectly with the Oriental lifestyle ambiance infused in this French-style apartment.</p>
										<p>The ceremonial ritual of hand-drip coffee intertwined with nostalgic surroundings makes The Cottage a paradigm of urban spiritual healing. Amid the wave of specialty coffee culture, it remains committed to a slow-paced neighborhood warmth. When dusk paints Wukang Mansion’s ship-bow relief red, sitting here savoring a cup of Old Mike’s coffee is like drinking in a living history of Shanghai life—turning a century-old building from a cold landmark into a breathing, warm container of urban memory.</p>

				<p>As a native Shanghainese who was born and raised in an atmosphere rich in local culture, I have always been captivated by the history of my city and its remarkable transformation over the past 100 years. I inherited my self-recognition as Shanghainese from my grandma — the dear language she speaks and the nostalgic photos she showed me of her past life are all magical capsules of eternal times. I am determined to grab my one and only digital camera to create my own time capsules for the city, and this is the origin of the idea “Shanghai 100 Years” — an endeavor to juxtapose historical photographs with present-day scenes taken from the exact same standpoints. Through this visual discourse and time channel, I seek to reveal the unique cultural energy that bursts when exterior and interior beauty merge in Shanghai’s urban landscape.</p>
				<p>Inspired by my love for coffee culture, I pair each historical comparison with a nearby café, not to comment on the brew, but to celebrate the stories these places hold and the aesthetics they reflect. Shanghai’s relationship with coffee began when the city first opened up as a trading port in 1843. The small coffee cherries from the hills of Colombia were once a luxury enjoyed by Western elites in hotels and churches, which soon evolved into something more profound when it was shipped to Shanghai. By the 1920s and 30s, cafés had become hubs for intellectuals — Lu Xun wrote in Gongfei Cafe, Tian Han edited scripts over coffee, and Zhang Ailing described it with elegant affection.</p>
				<p>Today, Shanghai is home to nearly 8000 cafés, boasting the highest coffee shop density in the world. More than just a beverage, coffee has woven itself into the very fabric of the city — from traditional market stalls to trendy internet-famous spaces, creativity and local culture seep into coffee, making it a unique symbol you cannot find in any other place in the world. </p>
				<p>Together, architecture and coffee tell the same tale: how Shanghai embraced a foreign import and made it part of its own rhythm. Through these dimensions — visual, historical, and sensory — I invite you all to experience Shanghai not just as a city, but as a living narrative of resilience and reinvention.</p>
