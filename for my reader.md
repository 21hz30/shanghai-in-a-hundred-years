As a native Shanghainese who was born and raised in an atmosphere rich in local culture, I have always been captivated by the history of my city and its remarkable transformation over the past 100 years. I inherited my self-recognition as Shanghainese from my grandma — the dear language she speaks and the nostalgic photos she showed me of her past life are all magical capsules of eternal times. I am determined to grab my one and only digital camera to create my own time capsules for the city, and this is the origin of the idea “Shanghai 100 Years” — an endeavor to juxtapose historical photographs with present-day scenes taken from the exact same standpoints. Through this visual discourse and time channel, I seek to reveal the unique cultural energy that bursts when exterior and interior beauty merge in Shanghai’s urban landscape.

Inspired by my love for coffee culture, I pair each historical comparison with a nearby café, not to comment on the brew, but to celebrate the stories these places hold and the aesthetics they reflect. Shanghai’s relationship with coffee began when the city first opened up as a trading port in 1843. The small coffee cherries from the hills of Colombia were once a luxury enjoyed by Western elites in hotels and churches, which soon evolved into something more profound when it was shipped to Shanghai. By the 1920s and 30s, cafés had become hubs for intellectuals — Lu Xun wrote in Gongfei Cafe, Tian Han edited scripts over coffee, and Zhang Ailing described it with elegant affection.

Today, Shanghai is home to nearly 8000 cafés, boasting the highest coffee shop density in the world. More than just a beverage, coffee has woven itself into the very fabric of the city — from traditional market stalls to trendy internet-famous spaces, creativity and local culture seep into coffee, making it a unique symbol you cannot find in any other place in the world. 

Together, architecture and coffee tell the same tale: how Shanghai embraced a foreign import and made it part of its own rhythm. Through these dimensions — visual, historical, and sensory — I invite you all to experience Shanghai not just as a city, but as a living narrative of resilience and reinvention.
